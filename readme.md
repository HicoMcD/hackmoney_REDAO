basic setup for the hackathon.


First version:
contribute an NFT representing a property as a stake,
receive a number of ERC20  tokens as a 100/100 fraction of the NFT

NFTs represent the value of the Real Estate - but it's not liquid. We may be able to use these NFTs to get DeFi based loans. We also then need to use revenues from Real Estate, by converting them to Stablecoins (ERC20, Fiat Backed) to pay the Loan Fees and Interest payments.



Second version:
realestateDAO full functionality? - more questions than answers-
ERC20 tokens on the open market-
Can we set ERC721 tokens as collateral in other DeFi products?

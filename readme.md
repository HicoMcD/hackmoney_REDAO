basic setup for the hackathon.


First version:
contribute an NFT representing a property as a stake,
receive a number of ERC20  tokens as a 100/100 fraction of the NFT


Second version:
realestateDAO full functionality? - more questions than answers-
ERC20 tokens on the open market-
Can we set ERC721 tokens as collateral in other DeFi products?

basic setup for the hackathon.


First version:
contribute an NFT representing a property as a stake,
receive a number of ERC20  tokens as a 100/100 fraction of the NFT

NFTs represent the value of the Real Estate - but it's not liquid. We may be able to use these NFTs to get DeFi based loans. We also then need to use revenues from Real Estate, by converting them to Stablecoins (ERC20, Fiat Backed) to pay the Loan Fees and Interest payments.

This sounds interesting which can work. Howw much do we care about whom certifies the real world NFT with a Chainlink data call? I dont think we have to worry that much for the prototype because I'm seeing some new projects which leverages the expertise of individuals such as real estate agents. We could also use virtual land NFT's whih should be much easier verifying than real world property. Then possibly just focus on bringing in different real world property financial mechanisms into the virtual real estate such as you mentioned with borrowing and lending, maybe even go create a mortgage feature or something that is real estate specific.

I'll also start researching into this idea specifically.

Second version:
realestateDAO full functionality? - more questions than answers-
ERC20 tokens on the open market-
Can we set ERC721 tokens as collateral in other DeFi products?
